## About

SMEFund is a software system that enables SMEs to access funds from Funders. The goal of this app is to create an easy way these SMEs can have access to fund, manage and report their activities to these Funders who funded them. 

This is the backend of the project which is API based. 

Api documentation is available here https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11412929/SzmjyaDv

- Jest: For runnung tests. We strongly recommend that JavaScript projects use Jest

- Eslint & Prettier: For formatting code to match ESlint AirBnB coding standard. You might need to install the ESlint and Prettier plugins for your code editor to make the most of these utilities

## Why

This is a project management system restricted between SMEs and Funders. This has been implemented under the guidance and powered by #BuildForSDG from Facebook Developer Circle and Andela. This system is useful for SMEs as well as the following kinds of Funders: Investors, NGOs, Government and its agencies, and philanthropists.

## Usage
 How would someone use what you have built, include URLs to the deployed app, service e.t.c when you have it setup


## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you don't have any of them already installed. We recommend NPM though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `npm install` to get started by installing dependencies. 

`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

To start the development server run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` . Note that production server can be started at `npm run start`

All tests should be written in the `__tests__' folder. There's a sample in there.

This starter uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) as the bundler. It is much simpler that WebPack and the others

#### Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
